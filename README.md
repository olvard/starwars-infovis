This is a interactive node based information visualization done with js and the d3 library. It aims to visualize the interactions of different characters throughout episode 1-7 and with the option to view all characters.

- Clicking a node will display a tooltip with the exact number of scenes
- The 'Distance' slider will adjust the link distance between nodes to allow for easier viewing
- The 'Interaction' slider will filter out the nodes with highest number of scenes.
